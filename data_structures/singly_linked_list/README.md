# Singly Linked List

## Time complexity

Insertion at beginning/end: **O(1)**, faster than an array when inserting at beginning/end
Deletion at beginning: **O(1)**
Deletion at end: **O(N)**
Deletion at middle: **O(N)**
Searching: **O(N)**
Access: **O(N)**

* Singly linked lists excel at frequent insertion and deletion.

* Arrays contain a built in index whereas linked lists do not.

* The idea of a list data structure consisting of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues.
