# Pivot helper

Write a function which takes an array, a start point and an end point, and returns the index of the pivot.

In this case, the pivot should be the first element.

The function should mutate the array (not create a new one) and make it such that the element at the pivot index is sorted and that every element on the left side is less, and every element on the right side is greater.
