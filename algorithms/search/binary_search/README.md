# Binary Search Exercise

Write a function called `binarySearch` which accepts a sorted array and a value and returns the index at which the value exists. Otherwise, return -1.

This algorithm should be more efficient than linearSearch - you can read how to implement it here - https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/binary-search and here - https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/
